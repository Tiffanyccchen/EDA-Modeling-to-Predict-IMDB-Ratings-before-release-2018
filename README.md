# EDA-Modeling-to-Predict-IMDB-Ratings-before-release-2018
A Complete Research Project for the College Student Research Program of Ministry of Technology 

## Introduction
EDA and Modeling to analyze and predict important factors of the IMDB score

* Data:
   * Two sources:
      1. [Data1](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) is on Kaggle.
      2. [Data2](https://github.com/sundeepblue/movie_rating_prediction/blob/master/movie_metadata.csv) is from the original provider of Data1.   
   (They are originally the same, but Kaggle change the data for copyright issues.)

I also extract the essence and share it on [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/tiffanyccchen/eda-modeling-to-predict-ratings-before-release) using Data1.

* EDA : 
   * contains  Histogram, Scatter plot, Bar plot, Box plot, and Word Cloud
   * Types of analysis:
      1. Continuous factors' distrubutions and relationships with IMDB (Histogram, Scatter Plot)
      2. Diecrete factors' distributions and relationships with IMDB (Bar Plot, Box Plot)
      3. Sequels' Trend Analysis
      4. PCA
      5. Important Actors/ Directors/ Production companies in different ranges of scores. (Word Cloud)
* Modeling: 
    * Two types of prediction :  
      1. IMDB Score: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM  
      2. IMDB Score larger or smaller than the median : Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM

* Report:
    * The analyzation results are written in  科技部大專學生研究計劃-前進奧斯卡的秘訣-電影評價的模型建立、探討與預測.pdf.

## Notice
The project is written when I was a junior, therefore codes are rather messy.   
However, it still showcase my ability to conduct a data analysis project from preprocessing to modeling.
