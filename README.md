# EDA-Modeling-to-Predict-IMDB-Ratings-before-release-2018
A Complete Research Project for the College Student Research Program of Ministry of Technology 

## Introduction
EDA and Modeling to analyze and predict important factors of the IMDB score.

* Two sources of data
[Data1](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) is on Kaggle.
[Data2](https://github.com/sundeepblue/movie_rating_prediction/blob/master/movie_metadata.csv) 

I also extract the essence and share it on [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/tiffanyccchen/eda-modeling-to-predict-ratings-before-release) using Data1.

* EDA : contains  scatter plot, bar plot, box plot, and word cloud.
* Modeling: 
    *  Two types of prediction :  
      1. IMDB Score: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM  
      2. IMDB Score larger or smaller than the median : Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM

* Report:
    * The analyzation results are written in  科技部大專學生研究計劃-前進奧斯卡的秘訣-電影評價的模型建立、探討與預測.pdf.

## Notice
The project is written when I was a junior, therefore codes are rather messy.
However, it still showcase my ability to conduct a data analysis project from preprocessing to modeling.
